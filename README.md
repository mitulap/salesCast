# salesCast
This repository is for salesCast project which implements solutions for smart check out counters in super market.
Internet of Things is highly useful in various management systems. Our project,
SalesCast uses advantage of IOT in Retail Management System. As the number of
supermarkets are increasing day by day, keeping track of each store is becoming a
tedious job. Manager at stores need to keep track of the inventory manually. Orders at
warehouses are placed manually. No centralized system exist which helps each store
and supermarket with sales forecasting and the vendors are unable to decide the
product and quantity of product for the next order. The main motivation is to provide
vendors with a system that will notify vendors about the low inventory levels and directly
place order at the warehouses based on the sales forecasting results.
Main goal of SalesCast is to provide sales forecast to stores of small to large scale and
supermarkets. SalesCast will gather data from the registered store and will recommend
them the next purchase of products based on the current inventory and future sale. This
system will track the inventory of each store to facilitate recommendation process.
According to data this system will also give notification to warehouses for their possible
sale in particular period of time based on the consumption of particular product.
The new system will eliminate various issues that we currently face. The system will
continuously monitor the inventory and will be able to make certain decisions
autonomously. With the use of Internet of Things, stores will be able to find the demand
of each product and plan the inbound shipments accordingly to avoid delay.

# Background
Supply chain management involves managing how the goods and services flow within a
distributed chain of retailers and factories. This chain starts right from movement of all
the raw materials required to the generation of finished goods and how they reach from
its source to the destination i.e. the customers. It a strong interconnected cycle that is
carefully designed so that all the operations take place smoothly.
One of the parts of this cycle is the communication between the warehouses and
supermarkets for order supply chain management. If the supermarkets run out of stock,
they immediately contact warehouses to order the needful. Considering the above case,
we have integrated IOT to make this ordering process dynamic, fast and efficient.

# Objectives
● To dynamically maintain a detailed information about the stock of the products
that are being sold out.
● To dynamically determine the shelf number where the products has to be placed
when the product enters the market.
● To dynamically track the products shipped to the destination.
